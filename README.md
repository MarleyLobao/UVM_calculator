# UVM_calculator

## Project Description

This repository is meant for learning UVM using SystemVerilog. Through a verification environment, some hardware verification concepts are applied for a calculator with the four basic operations.

## üî® Project Features

This project is capable of performing functional verification of a simple calculator (that performs the four basic arithmetic operations) developed in Systemverilog by creating a verification environment developed according to the UVM methodology.

## ‚úîÔ∏è Techniques and technologies used

- `Systemverilog`
- `UVM`
- `Functional Verification`
- `Simulation of a verification environment`

## üìÅ Access to the project

You can [download the project's source code](https://github.com/MarleyLobao/UVM_calculator.git).

## üõ†Ô∏è Execute the project

The Makefile in the `tb/rundir/` directory has the following options:
- `make sim`: Run the project with Xcelium Logic Simulator from Cadence;
- `make gui`: Run the simulation using Simvision's GUI.

When you run `calculator_test` you should notice at the end of the log that all the results match with the reference model and the planned coverage has been achieved üèÜ
